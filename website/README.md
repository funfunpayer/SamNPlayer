# Public product site (source)

Static landing + guides + notes for SamNPlayer. English product language
(`docs/LANGUAGE.md`). Visual tokens match the desktop GUI (dark ink,
gold + teal, Space Grotesk). Product framing: **Emotion Generator** /
**Emotion Script** (`docs/EMOTION_SCRIPT.md`).

## Structure

```text
website/
  index.html          Landing (hero, why, product, guides teaser, €40, download)
  faq.html
  changelog.html
  guides/             Getting started, Neo 2 BLE, license import
  blog/               Buyer-facing notes (AI, quality, portable, Tf/Tj, vs FunGen)
  media/              Mirrored screenshots + logo (from docs/media/)
  fonts/              Space Grotesk
```

Content plan: `docs/SELLING.md` → “Site content map”.

Refresh GUI screenshots after UI branding changes:

```bash
cd cmd/gui-wails/frontend && npm run build
python3 scripts/capture-gui-screenshots.py
cp -a docs/media/gui-*.png docs/media/logo.png docs/media/wordmark.png website/media/
```

## Local preview

```bash
cd website
python3 -m http.server 8765
# open http://127.0.0.1:8765/
```

## Publish to the showcase repo

The public face is [`funfunpayer/SamNPlayer-site`](https://github.com/funfunpayer/SamNPlayer-site)
(no application source). After this tree is approved:

```bash
./scripts/sync-public-site.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/funfunpayer/SamNPlayer-site.git
rsync -a \
  --exclude README.md \
  website/ SamNPlayer-site/
# keep SamNPlayer-site SETUP.md / LICENSE; site root = Pages /
cp docs/site-README.md SamNPlayer-site/README.md
cd SamNPlayer-site
git add -A && git commit -m "site: Emotion Generator landing" && git push
```

Then enable **GitHub Pages** on `SamNPlayer-site` (branch `main`, `/` root)
and set the repo homepage URL.

Media under `website/media/` is a mirror of `docs/media/` so images keep
working when the app repo is private (`docs/CLOSED_SOURCE.md`).

## Do not

- Point image `src` at `raw.githubusercontent.com/.../SamNPlayer/...` once
  the app repo is private.
- Turn the first viewport into a dashboard of stats or feature cards.
- Paste internal engineering journals into `/blog/`.
- Call the product format “Funscript” in buyer-facing copy — use Emotion Script.
