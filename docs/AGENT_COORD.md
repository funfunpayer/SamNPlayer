# Agent coordination (Cursor ↔ Claude ↔ ChatGPT)

Shared board **inside the repo** so agents split work without colliding.
Update this file when you claim or finish work. Product docs English;
talk to the owner in German.

**Not** a second roadmap (`ROADMAP.md` / `PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md`).
This file = **who owns what now** + the shared target.

## North star (do not lose this)

```text
  Ship a boring, reliable Generate → funscript → Neo 2 path
  that feels right without forcing the user to mark everything.

  Order (PRODUCTION_ROADMAP):
    G0 stable CSRT  →  G1 classical heuristics + audio
                    →  G2 Neo2 feel  →  G3 AI helpers only
```

Near-term product slice (owner-locked): `docs/TFTJ_PROFILE_DIRECTION.md`
— Tf/Tj = **profile/feel**, contact vib on Normal (done #149), mark partner
only when vib needs it, no-mark classical toward FunGen-like UX.

Perception research (do **not** leapfrog product): `docs/SAM_ARCHITECTURE.md`
§ Perception v1 — bake-off observers **before** any Go port / fusion default.
**Bake-off done 21 Sep (#154):** no Go port for flow/grid_lk/region_fusion.

**Rule:** piece by piece. One improvement ships and is measured before the
next big theme. Prefer cleanup + focus over parallel feature sprawl.

## Sprint order (21 Sep — all agents)

| # | What | Who | Status |
|---|------|-----|--------|
| **0** | Cleanup | Claude + ChatGPT E | Done (#150/#151/#146/#152/#154) |
| **1** | Bake-off | Claude B | **DONE** #154 — no Go port |
| **2** | **v0.5.17** | Cursor A | **IN PROGRESS** #153 — owner smoked 0.5.16 OK |
| **3** | TFTJ step 3 partner-mark | ChatGPT or Cursor C | Queued after tag |
| **4** | #145/#119 + metadata + **flow hang** | ChatGPT E | Claimed (handoff #152 merged) |

## Cleanup checklist

- [x] #150 provenance fix
- [x] #151 AGENT_COORD on `main`
- [x] #146 closed
- [x] #152 ChatGPT lane E handoff merged
- [x] Bake-off results in `SAM_ARCHITECTURE.md` + NEXT (#154)
- [x] No Go ports of flow/grid_lk from this bake-off

## Active

| Lane | Owner | Branch / PR | Goal | Status |
|------|-------|-------------|------|--------|
| B | Claude | #154 merged | Bake-off vs FunGen2 | **DONE** — lane free |
| A | Cursor | #153 `cursor/release-0-5-17-d7cb` | v0.5.17 bump + tag | **IN PROGRESS** |
| E | ChatGPT | new branch off main | Triage #145/#119, metadata stamp, **flow hang** | **Claimed** — continue after #152 |
| C | — | — | TFTJ step 3 | **Queued** after 0.5.17 |

## ChatGPT handoff — 21 Sep

Claim: lane E (docs claim #152 merged).

- #146 closed. #145/#119 still open — need current-build reproduce before close.
- Owner: **0.5.16 portable smoke already done** (Go path) — proceed to 0.5.17 tag after #153.
- Metadata stamping: hypothesis from #150; inspect import/re-save before changing code.
- **New from bake-off:** `flow` backend hangs (5min on 280s clip, 3min on 50s) — root-cause in lane E; contradicts “faster than CSRT” docstring.

## Decision log

| Date | Decision | By |
|------|----------|-----|
| 21 Sep | Contact vib on Normal/Auto default on | Owner → #149 |
| 21 Sep | Bake-off before any observer Go port | Agree |
| 21 Sep | Three agents use this board | Owner |
| 21 Sep | Bake-off: grid_lk/region_fusion do not beat CSRT; no Go port. flow hangs → E | Claude #154 |
| 21 Sep | Owner smoked 0.5.16 → continue 0.5.17 | Owner |

---

## Rules

1. One theme per agent. Claim in **Active** before coding.
2. Base on current `main`.
3. Docs/bake-off do not block release tags unless behavior changes.
4. No silent tracker/profile default changes.
5. Finish → Done row + free lane + PR link.
6. Never force-push another agent’s claimed tip.

### ChatGPT onboarding

1. Read **Active** — skip RUNNING lanes.
2. Read `TFTJ_PROFILE_DIRECTION.md` + `SAM_ARCHITECTURE.md` § Perception v1.
3. Lane E work: #145/#119/metadata/`flow` hang — no Generate default changes.
4. PR body: `AGENT_COORD:` block; update Active in same PR.
