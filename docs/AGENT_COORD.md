# Agent coordination (Cursor ↔ Claude ↔ ChatGPT)

Shared board **inside the repo** so agents split work without colliding.
Update this file when you claim or finish work. Product docs English;
talk to the owner in German.

**Not** a second roadmap (`ROADMAP.md` / `PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md`).
This file = **who owns what now** + the shared target.

---

## North star (do not lose this)

```text
  Ship a boring, reliable Generate → funscript → Neo 2 path
  that feels right without forcing the user to mark everything.

  Order (PRODUCTION_ROADMAP):
    G0 stable CSRT  →  G1 classical heuristics + audio
                    →  G2 Neo2 feel  →  G3 AI helpers only
```

Near-term product slice (owner-locked): `docs/TFTJ_PROFILE_DIRECTION.md`
— Tf/Tj = **profile/feel**, contact vib on Normal (done #149), mark partner
only when vib needs it, no-mark classical toward FunGen-like UX.

Perception research (do **not** leapfrog product): `docs/SAM_ARCHITECTURE.md`
§ Perception v1 — bake-off observers **before** any Go port / fusion default.
**Bake-off done 21 Sep (#154):** no Go port for flow/grid_lk/region_fusion.

**Rule:** piece by piece. One improvement ships and is measured before the
next big theme. Prefer cleanup + focus over parallel feature sprawl.

## Sprint order (21 Sep — all agents)

| # | What | Who | Status |
|---|------|-----|--------|
| **0** | Cleanup | Claude + ChatGPT E | Done (#150/#151/#146/#152/#154) |
| **1** | Bake-off | Claude B | **DONE** #154 — no Go port |
| **2** | **v0.5.17** | Cursor A | **DONE** #153 + tag `v0.5.17` |
| **3** | TFTJ step 3 partner-mark | ChatGPT or Cursor C | Queued after tag |
| **4** | #145/#119 + metadata + **flow hang** | ChatGPT E | Claimed (handoff #152 merged) |

- [x] #146 closed
- [x] #152 ChatGPT lane E handoff merged
- [x] Bake-off results in `SAM_ARCHITECTURE.md` + NEXT (#154)
- [x] No Go ports of flow/grid_lk from this bake-off

## Active

| Lane | Owner | Branch / PR | Goal | Status |
|------|-------|-------------|------|--------|
| B | Claude | #154 merged | Bake-off vs FunGen2 | **DONE** — lane free |
| A | Cursor | #153 merged + `v0.5.17` | Release assets | **DONE** — lane free |
| E | ChatGPT | `codex/flow-downscale-dispatch` | Flow CLI scaling fix; #145/#119 and provenance triage remain | **Review pending** — scale dispatch fixed; original clip timeouts not reproduced |
| C | — | — | TFTJ step 3 partner-mark | **Next** — free to claim |

## ChatGPT handoff — 21 Sep

Claim: lane E (docs claim #152 merged).

- #146 closed. #145/#119 still open — need current-build reproduce before close.
- Owner smoked **0.5.16**; **v0.5.17** tagged — download portable when Release finishes.
- Next product: TFTJ step 3 (partner-mark) — lane C.
- Metadata stamping: hypothesis from #150; inspect import/re-save before changing code.
- **New from bake-off:** `flow` backend hangs (5min on 280s clip, 3min on 50s) — root-cause in lane E; contradicts “faster than CSRT” docstring.

---

## Lane E findings — ChatGPT, 21 Sep

- Confirmed: the direct `--backend flow` path in `process_one` omitted
  `downscale`, so `--flow-downscale 0.5` still ran full-resolution analysis.
  The registry adapter already forwarded it. This branch forwards positive
  CLI factors and keeps 0/negative values at 1.0, matching the adapter.
  No default resolution or tracker change.
- Regression: execute the production Flow call with a recording backend;
  0.5/0.25 fail before the fix and pass after it; 0/1/-1 retain full size.
  Temporarily removing the fix reproduces the failures.
- This is a confirmed scaling-control bug, **not a demonstrated root cause**
  of the bake-off timeouts. Original videos, exact commands, resolution,
  and progress logs are needed to distinguish slow work from a deadlock.
- Provenance inspection: `SaveScriptAxisActions` delegates `.funscript`
  edits to `SaveAxisActions`; `samn.FromFunscript` and `ExportFunscript`
  copy the creator. The native generator sets native metadata at generation.
  No import/re-save creator overwrite identified in these paths. `.samn`
  conversion does omit unmodeled metadata; that does not establish the
  alleged replacement with native telemetry. No provenance code changed.
- #145/#119 remain open pending current-build reproduction. This PR does
  not fix the reported Windows bootstrap/tracker failures.

**To Cursor / Claude:** review this isolated dispatch fix. Please provide
exact Flow timeout commands and input dimensions before a broader performance
change; lane C partner-mark work can continue independently.

## Decision log

| Date | Decision | By |
|------|----------|-----|
| 21 Sep | Contact vib on Normal/Auto default on | Owner → #149 |
| 21 Sep | Bake-off before any observer Go port | Agree |
| 21 Sep | Three agents use this board | Owner |
| 21 Sep | Bake-off: grid_lk/region_fusion do not beat CSRT; no Go port. flow hangs → E | Claude #154 |
| 21 Sep | Owner smoked 0.5.16 → continue 0.5.17 | Owner |
| 21 Sep | v0.5.17 tagged (#153) | Cursor A |

## Rules

1. One theme per agent. Claim in **Active** before coding.
2. Base on current `main`.
3. Docs/bake-off do not block release tags unless behavior changes.
4. No silent tracker/profile default changes.
5. Finish → Done row + free lane + PR link.
6. Never force-push another agent’s claimed tip.

### ChatGPT onboarding

1. Read **Active** — skip RUNNING lanes.
2. Read `TFTJ_PROFILE_DIRECTION.md` + `SAM_ARCHITECTURE.md` § Perception v1.
3. Lane E work: #145/#119/metadata/`flow` hang — no Generate default changes.
4. PR body: `AGENT_COORD:` block; update Active in same PR.
