# AI training system — guide (what / where / how)

As of September 2026 · SamNPlayer **0.5.5+**

This document explains the **regions model** (YOLO → ONNX) and the small
**generation-profile model** (motion signatures → Go), not device **Training**
in the Training tab (stop-start/plateau).

## Quick: what AI may do — and what not

| May | May not |
|-----|---------|
| Suggest region(s) | Write Funscripts |
| Suggest Normal / Soft / Autotune | Change a profile without Apply |
| Offer a typed box; **Apply target** sets it | Replace tracking or auto-apply a semantic target |
| Learn locally on your machine | Cloud / telemetry / bundled model |

Classic tracking (CSRT / flow / …) writes `.samn` (native) plus a
community `.funscript` export. AI still never writes either file by itself.
See also `docs/SAMN_FORMAT.md`, `docs/AI_ADAPTER.md` and `docs/FUNSCRIPT_ALGOS.md`.

## Two different local models

| Model | Learns from | Runtime | Result |
|-------|-------------|---------|--------|
| Body-part region model | Corrected image boxes in this tab | ONNX Runtime | Tip/contact box proposal |
| Generation-profile model | Create → remembered scene + selected Style | Go classification; local OpenCV signature extraction | Normal/Soft/Autotune proposal |

The Go model is intentionally small and explainable: OpenCV measures eight
motion features, Go training computes a centroid and observed spread per profile,
and Go classification rejects unfamiliar or ambiguous scenes. Measuring a new
video still uses the existing local Python/OpenCV adapter, but does not need
PyTorch, a GPU, a server or Internet access. The resulting profile is shown in
Create with an explicit **Apply** button; the existing CSRT/post-processing
pipeline still writes the script.

### Train the generation-profile model

1. In **Create**, choose a video and the Style that produced the desired result.
2. Open **Power-user: scene memory**, give the scene a name and select
   **Remember scene + style**.
3. Repeat for at least two scenes. More varied confirmed examples are better;
   include each Style that should be learned.
4. In **AI training**, select **Train Go profile model**.
5. Return to Create and choose **Suggest profile**. Nothing is applied until
   **Apply** is pressed, and generation remains the normal Create action.

The JSONL examples are append-only and human-readable. Older examples whose
name itself is `standard`, `weich`, `autotune`, `tf` or `tj` remain usable;
new examples store the selected profile explicitly in `parameters.profile`.

## Requirements

1. **Python 3** (same interpreter SamNPlayer finds — Windows: `py`/`python`)
2. **Base CV:** `opencv-contrib-python` (not `opencv-python` alone) — for bootstrap (video sampling). OpenCV 5: CSRT often missing → automatic KCF fallback (#95).
3. **Training:** `ultralytics` + `onnx` (pulls PyTorch)
4. **Inference (Generate tab):** `onnxruntime`
5. Optional: **ffmpeg** for still conversion / audio sidecar / player proxy

### Installation (GUI, recommended)

In the **AI training** tab → **Install AI train deps**.

This writes the embedded `requirements-ai-train.txt`, runs
`python -m pip install -r …`, then **restores `opencv-contrib-python`**
(ultralytics depends on plain `opencv-python`, which removes CSRT needed
for **Use for training** — Issues #94/#119). Works without a source tree
(release `.exe`).

On Windows, prefer a real install from [python.org](https://python.org)
(e.g. `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python\…`). The Microsoft Store / WindowsApps
stub on PATH is demoted so pip hints target the real interpreter.

### Installation (manual)

```bash
# Inference
pip install -r generator/requirements-ai.txt

# Training (+ PyTorch) — then restore contrib (ultralytics may replace it)
pip install -r generator/requirements-ai-train.txt
pip uninstall -y opencv-python opencv-python-headless
pip install opencv-contrib-python

# Windows without NVIDIA (optional):
pip install torch-directml
```

**0.5.9 / 0.5.10 workaround** (before the restore landed in 0.5.11): after
any ultralytics install, run the uninstall + `opencv-contrib-python` lines
above in the **same** Python SamNPlayer reports in the bootstrap error.

From the binary: Settings / or later “Export requirements” —
`WriteAIRequirementFiles(target folder)`.

## Step-by-step (GUI)

1. **AI training** tab
2. **Choose video** (or **image** for still annotation)
3. For black intro: seek time → load frame
4. Draw up to **9 boxes**, name classes with the English taxonomy
   (`face`, `mouth`, `breasts`, `nipples`, `hand_1`, `hand_2`, `penis`,
   `glans`, `vagina` — see `docs/BODY_REGIONS.md`). Legacy German labels
   (`brust`, `eichel`, …) still normalize.
5. **Use for training** → CSRT/KCF tracks and writes YOLO samples
6. **Review:** discard bad samples, **correct** boxes (important — bootstrap box size is fixed; tracker may drift)
7. **Start training** (epochs, device Auto/CUDA/DirectML/CPU)
8. Result: `roi_detector.onnx` under model path (Settings)
9. **Generate** tab → enable **Smarter tip find** → select the exact expected
   body point → seek to a frame where that point is clearly visible → **Find
   tip area**. Only that displayed frame is evaluated. Verify the displayed
   class, confidence and dashed box, then choose **Apply target**. A missing,
   weak or ambiguous class is not replaced by another detection; mark it
   manually or improve the data.

## Vision: what we use / what not

| Technique | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| YOLOv8n → ONNX ROI suggestion | **Product path** |
| Classic CSRT/KCF/flow | **writes Funscript** |
| Two-ROI AI (`find_two_rois`) | Code present, rarely measured in practice |
| Audio sidecar | stored only |
| 3D / depth / pose | **experimental** — classical depth proxy + optional ONNX stub in `support_signals.py`; opt-in ROI soft-rank only (`SAMNPLAYER_DEPTH_RANK=1`); no Funscript writer; bake-off required before default |

## Tips for good models

- Many short clips instead of one long one
- Correct boxes in review (bootstrap keeps fixed w/h)
- Optional **box scale** 1.1–1.2 for padding around the mark
- At least one val example (still path switches automatically)
- GPU strongly recommended; CPU only for smoke tests (few epochs)
- Keep `classes.json` beside the exported `.onnx`; strict target matching uses
  it to bind the canonical GUI class to the model-specific numeric ID.
- After training: use Generate → Smarter tip find → expected body point. The
  Settings **Preferred classes** list remains for legacy generic proposals; it
  is deliberately not a fallback for strict target matching.
- Draw the initial target box tightly. The optional target-locked Rhythm Grid
  starts inside that box and keeps the same grid cell for the whole shot;
  rhythm similarity alone cannot hand control to a stronger moving thigh. A
  scene cut starts a new, separately seeded shot without cross-cut FFT windows.
- 3D / depth / pose: experimental scaffold only — see `docs/DEPTH_POSE.md`; golden-clip win required before default

## Already transfer learning — how to go faster (22 Sep)

Training is **not** from scratch. `train_yolo_model.py` defaults to
`--base-model yolov8n.pt` (COCO-pretrained Ultralytics weights), then
fine-tunes on **your** body-part boxes → ONNX for Generate proposals.

| Speed / quality lever | Status | Notes |
|-----------------------|--------|-------|
| COCO `yolov8n.pt` fine-tune | **Already default** | Small + fast; keep unless data is huge |
| GPU (`--device auto`) | Wired | CUDA → MPS → DirectML → CPU |
| More corrected samples | Highest leverage | Review/correct beats bigger YOLO |
| `yolov8s` / YOLO26 later | Opt-in `--base-model` | Only after n plateaus on your classes |
| External body/hand ONNX as **proposal helper** | Idea (extra) | Suggest boxes only; never write Stroke; measure vs CSRT auto-ROI first |
| **PoseObserver** (RTMPose/MediaPipe) | **Stage A spike** | `pose_observer.py` + CLI; OS weights local only; see `docs/POSE_OBSERVER.md` |
| ByteTrack/BoT-SORT ID layer | Fahrplan MT-Speed/ID | After classical MT-Seed; not Stroke writer |
| Freeze backbone / fewer epochs | Easy CLI knobs later | Good once sample count is stable |

**Product rule stays:** AI may **suggest** Tip/body-part regions; CSRT
(Everyday, no AI required) still writes the curve. Do not swap Everyday
to a third-party model just to “train faster.”

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---------|-------------|
| “ultralytics missing” | Install AI train deps |
| Bootstrap fails: OpenCV without tracker / WindowsApps pip hint | Prefer real Python; Install AI train deps (restores contrib) or manual `pip uninstall opencv-python … && pip install opencv-contrib-python` (#119) |
| Bootstrap fails on OpenCV 5 | `opencv-contrib-python`; check KCF fallback |
| Training: empty val | at least 2 stills or video bootstrap |
| AI checkbox gray | no `.onnx` at model path |
| Poor suggestions | more/corrected samples; preferred classes; not “bigger YOLO” |
| Preferred class ignored | `classes.json` beside `.onnx` missing (retrain or copy) |
| Strict target reports `manifest_missing` / `manifest_invalid` / `class_unresolved` | keep a valid exported `classes.json` beside the ONNX model and ensure the selected canonical class exists in it |
| Strict target reports `target_not_detected` / `below_confidence` | keep the existing ROI, mark the target manually, or add corrected examples of that exact class |
| Strict target reports `ambiguous_target` | two separate boxes were similarly plausible; choose the correct point manually instead of allowing an automatic guess |
